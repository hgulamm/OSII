# Operating System
The goal of the project is to simulate a simple batch processing system. At the very basic level the system is designed to find the Hexadecimal value after instruction from Loader format. The approach to the problem is the given Hexadecimal loader format is loaded into the system and each byte is converted to binary format. Later the CPU reads the instructions and executes the operations based on the opcode. Once the Instruction set is specified, the CPU will take care of the execution steps in order to display the necessary output. The entire memory that has been used in the system is inherited from the MEMORY.
